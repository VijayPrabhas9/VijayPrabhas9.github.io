## ðŸš€ SC25 Poster â€“ GPU Acceleration & Optimizations of LESLIE
- Achieved **38Ã— speedup** on NVIDIA A100 vs 60-core Xeon CPU.
- Optimizations at kernel-level (loop fusion, register reuse), instruction-level (DFMA, branchless MERGE), and communication-level (CUDA-aware MPI, NCCL, UCX).
- Profiling with Nsight Systems/Compute and roofline analysis guided optimization strategy.
- **Result**: ConsToPrim kernel hit **57% FP64 peak utilization**.

## ðŸ”¬ Graduate Research Assistant â€“ LESLIE Solver Optimization
- Ported legacy Fortran90 + MPI CFD solver with OpenACC/NVHPC.
- Improved **SM busy >54%**, reduced warp stalls by **93%**, and increased compute throughput by **+413%**.
- Multi-node scaling across NVLink, PCIe, and InfiniBand interconnects.
- Submitted as research poster for **SC25 (St. Louis)**.

## âš¡ Multi-GPU Communication Benchmarks (AXPY)
- Developed benchmarks with MPI â†’ CUDA-aware MPI â†’ CUDA Streams â†’ NCCL â†’ UCX.
- Reduced communication latency from **45 ms â†’ 1.267 ms (18Ã— faster)** using CUDA-IPC and custom reductions.
- Benchmarked UCX transport selection (NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand) with Nsight Systems.

## ðŸŽ¥ 3D CNN + Non-Local Self-Attention (UCF-101)
- Built 3D CNN baseline + late-stage attention block â†’ **0.8357 accuracy** on 16-class subset.
- Profiling on NVIDIA H100 identified **65% Host-to-Device bottleneck**.
- Next step: implement fused TensorFlow CUDA op for attention.
